      <description>The GW4 Isambard Multi-Architecture Comparison System will be unavailable for the week of the 19th April to perform planned upgrades &amp;amp; maintenance of the software stack.
This is a major software upgrade to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, bringing the Operating System major version inline with the A64FX service, it will provide a better base for software development and improve the MACS compatibility with scientific software, including the Cray software stack.
Some user software compatibility issues are to be expected due to changed/updated libraries, so recompilations may be required to continue running on MACS.
XCI &amp;amp; A64FX remain available during this time.</description>

Hackthon Description The third in the Isambard hackathon series will take place online via Zoom, and focus on porting and optimising codes to the processor behind Fugaku, the fastest supercomputer in the world - the Arm-based A64fx from Fujitsu. Isambard now includes a rack of 72 A64fx processors, along with Cray, Arm and GNU compilers.
The hackathon will begin with a training session from Arm and Cray/HPE on the architecture and software tools, before moving into the hands-on part of the hackathon. All attendees will be given accounts on the Isambard A64fx Apollo 80 system for the duration of the event. Accounts may be available to continue porting activities post the event, upon request. For more details about the system, see:

Previous Isambard Hackathons Isambard has run two previous hackathons which were extremely successful. Run in October 2017 and March 2018, they were some of the very first public events porting HPC codes to production Arm hardware. This third Isambard hackathon is one of the very first such public events targetting the A64fx, and the first in Europe.
The Isambard 2 A64fx Apollo 80 system includes 72 A64fx CPUs, and Infiniband interconnect, and the Cray/HPE, Arm and GNU compilers for Arm. Hackathon attendees will be given training accounts on the system for the hackathon, and may be permitted to retain access after the hackathon to continue porting and optimisation activities.
Isambard is a UK National Tier-2 service, funded by EPSRC (EP/P020224/1). Isambard is run by the GW4 Alliance of the universities of Bristol, Bath, Cardiff and Exeter, along with the UK&amp;rsquo;s Met Office.
Previous results from Isambard were published at the Cray User Group workshops in 2018 and 2019, winning the best paper award in 2019:

      <description>Cray CCE 9.0.0 has been installed on XCI, feel free to test it out by loading the cdt/19.06 module!
This is a major revision to CCE with the compilers being based on LLVM.

      <title>Isambard XC50 software &amp; chip updates</title>
      <link>/posts/announcements/xci-software-and-chip-upgrade/</link>

      <guid>/posts/announcements/xci-software-and-chip-upgrade/</guid>
      <description>Next week (w/c 11th March), we will be shutting down XCI to upgrade both the hardware and system software. This process will likely take the full week, and so we expect to resume service from Monday 18th March.
These upgrades will move us to Cray Linux Environment 7.0, which bumps the underlying Operating System from SLES 12 to SLES 15. It is expected that this may cause existing dynamically linked executables to fail to run, so we recommend recompiling any such programs that you may have once the upgrade is completed. Note that after the upgrade, the minimum available Cray Developer Toolkit will be CDT 19.03, and so you may encounter some issues when recompiling your codes.
Updates 14 March: The upgrade is proceeding smoothly, XCI is running it&amp;rsquo;s new software stack on fresh chips!
We are working now to ensure the service is stable, configured correctly for user access and any hardware bugs are caught early.</description>

      <description>The single cabinet consists of approx 164 compute nodes of 64 cores each, for a total of 10&#39;496 cores of Cavium Thunder X2 ARMv8, backed by the same Aries interconnect. A 0.5 Petabyte Lustre filesystem is dedicated to the Isambard system.
Discussions are underway on acceptance tests, we expect to run HPL (LINPACK), HPCG, STREAM, MPI &amp;amp; I/O benchmarks. Some practical codes will also be run for comparison against the numbers produced on the Early Access nodes ( http://www.goingarm.com/slides/2017/SC17/GoingArm_SC17_Bristol_Isambard.pdf ), including UM/NEMO, a chemistry and an engineering code.
The HPC group at Bristol Uni has recently put out a paper on these numbers in more depth: https://uob-hpc.github.io/assets/cug-2018.pdf</description>

      <title>Isambard Hackathon #2 &#34;Stoking The Fire&#34;</title>

      <description>The second Isambard hackathon &amp;ldquo;Stoking The Fire&amp;rdquo; ended yesterday after a day and a half of hacking on the second half of the top 10 most common Archer codes + UM/NEMO. There were specialists for each code in attendance, Cray compiler developers and Cavium engineers.
I was really pleased to see the system handling the workload without incident and surprised that this time not a single node crashed! That alone makes the week it took to upgrade the ARM chips worth it!
There were bugs in some codes being run, there were even a couple of compiler and performance tool bugs discovered and raised with Cray; At this early stage every bug found is a step towards getting the platform closer to operational quality!
I spent my time helping users, applying hotfixes, investigating enhancement requests and eating the sandwiches.
The following codes were run successfully:
