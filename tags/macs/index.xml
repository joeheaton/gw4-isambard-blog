      <description>The GW4 Isambard Multi-Architecture Comparison System will be unavailable for the week of the 19th April to perform planned upgrades &amp;amp; maintenance of the software stack.
This is a major software upgrade to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, bringing the Operating System major version inline with the A64FX service, it will provide a better base for software development and improve the MACS compatibility with scientific software, including the Cray software stack.
Some user software compatibility issues are to be expected due to changed/updated libraries, so recompilations may be required to continue running on MACS.
XCI &amp;amp; A64FX remain available during this time.</description>
